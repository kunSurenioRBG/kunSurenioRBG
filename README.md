<ul>
  <li>Currently working in my free time at Uniway, the all-in-one app for university life. It combines an exclusive student marketplace with a private social network, allowing you to buy, sell, and connect safely within your own campus.</li>
  <li>Also working at Veronda, developing solutions for managing invoices, receipts, and contracts with automation powered by AI agents.</li>
  <li>I work on <strong>neural rendering</strong> and <strong>novel view synthesis</strong> using <strong>Gaussian Splatting</strong> and <strong>YOLO</strong> for 3D scene segmentation — check out <a href="https://github.com/kunSurenioRBG/NeuroView">NeuroView</a></li>
  <li>I’ve built deep learning models using <strong>CNNs</strong>, <strong>U-Net</strong>, and <strong>Transformers</strong> for tasks like segmentation, restoration, and scene analysis for 3D scenes, such as in video games or graphics engines — check out <a href="https://github.com/kunSurenioRBG/RenderFlowAA">RenderFlowAA</a></li>
  <li>I’ve worked with state-of-the-art architectures like <strong>VRT</strong>, <strong>EDVR</strong>, and <strong>NAFNet</strong> for image and video restoration</li>
  <li>I’ve explored generative models like <strong>Stable Diffusion</strong> and <strong>GANs</strong> for image synthesis and transformation</li>
  <li>I’ve run deep learning workflows on <strong>high-performance computing systems</strong> like the <a href="https://www.scbi.uma.es/web/es/supercomputacion/"><strong>Picasso</strong></a> supercomputer, optimizing training and inference at scale</li>
  <li>I like Pokémon and pan con aceite🦆</li>
</ul>
